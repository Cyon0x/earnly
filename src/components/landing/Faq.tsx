  {
    q: "What is Earnly?",
    a: "Earnly helps students discover opportunities, build skills, earn through work and access new financial tools from one platform.",
  },
  {
    q: "Who can use Earnly?",
    a: "Earnly is designed for students and young people globally. Every account goes through student verification before it can apply for work.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I create an account?",
    a: "You can create an account using Google or the available email authentication option. Both take you straight into student verification.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to verify my university?",
    a: "University information helps personalize your Earnly experience and connect you with relevant opportunities. Verification is what makes the badge on your profile mean something to a poster.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I add my university if it isn't listed?",
    a: "Yes. Search for your university first, and if it isn't available, you can manually enter its name, country and city. It is saved to your profile.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I add skills that aren't listed?",
    a: "Yes. Earnly allows you to add custom skills. They sit alongside the built-in library and appear on your profile exactly like the rest.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are the financial products currently available?",
    a: "Some products may initially be introduced as Coming Soon while the underlying infrastructure is being built. Asset Leasing, Inventory Loans and the Digital Pawn Shop are previews today — no listings, loans, pledges or payments are processed for them yet.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Earnly available outside Nigeria?",
    a: "Yes. Earnly is being designed as a global platform with users and universities from around the world. Payouts are denominated in USDC, and off-ramp to local currency is on the roadmap.",
  },
  {
    q: "How does Earnly make money?",
    a: "Students keep 100% of what they are paid for work. No revenue model has been switched on for this prototype — anything published here would be a claim we cannot yet support.",
