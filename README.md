# Earnly

**Verified student opportunity and earning platform.** Students confirm they are
students, find paid tasks, jobs and internships, get paid in USDC, collect
ratings from the people who paid them, and graduate with a record of real work
instead of an empty CV.

The core loop the product is built around:

> **Verify → Discover → Apply → Work → Get paid → Build reputation → Gain experience**

This is a hackathon/grant prototype. Everything below marked *demo* is
deliberately mocked and the interface says so on screen.

## Running it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev       # http://localhost:3000
npm run build     # production build (webpack)
npm run lint
npm run db:migrate  # applies db/migrations/*.sql to DATABASE_URL
```

Node 20.9+ (Next.js 16 requirement). Fonts are self-hosted in `public/fonts`,
so the build does not need network access.

### Environment variables

Copy the shape below into `.env.local` for development, and set the same keys
in **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables** for production.
`.env.local` is gitignored; no secret is ever committed.

```
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=        # Google OAuth client id (server-side)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=    # Google OAuth client secret — server-side only
DATABASE_URL=            # Neon Postgres connection string
DATABASE_URL_POOLED=     # Neon pooler connection string (used at runtime)
AUTH_SECRET=             # 32+ random bytes, signs the session cookie
APP_URL=                 # public origin, e.g. https://earnly-app.vercel.app
```

`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL` and `AUTH_SECRET` are only read inside
server modules (`src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/lib/db.ts`, `src/lib/session.ts`) and
never reach the browser. `APP_URL` decides the OAuth callback: the redirect
sent to Google is `APP_URL + /api/auth/google/callback`, so that exact URL must
be registered as an authorised redirect URI on the Google OAuth client (add
`http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback` too, for local work).

## Design

The visual system was produced with the **App Designer** skill in the
terminal, not chosen up front. Three directions for the dashboard were
rendered and compared (`design/app-designer/directions.html`, renders in
`design/app-designer/out/`), and the winner is written down in
`design/DIRECTION.md`:

> **Earnly is a campus night market.** Stalls open after the last lecture;
> every stall is a piece of paid work, every price tag is real.

- **Signature shape:** the tag — a rectangle with one squared corner.
- **Depth:** a hard offset shadow, never a soft one and never a glow.
- **Accent:** one lamp-amber, used only for the primary action and "now".
- **Type:** Archivo (variable width) for everything; Geist Mono for every
  number. Seven type sizes, nothing below 11px.
- **Two themes, both designed:** night ink (default) and chalk paper (light),
  not an inversion. Switch with the sidebar toggle.

The landing hero is a real campus photograph, art-directed with a duotone
treatment and overlapping product panels rather than a screenshot in a frame.

## What is real and what is mocked

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Landing page | Built |
| Auth (Google + email) | **Real** — Google OAuth 2.0 with PKCE, email sign-up/sign-in with scrypt-hashed passwords, signed HttpOnly session cookie, duplicate accounts prevented by provider id then email |
| Database | **Real** — Neon Postgres (`users`, `auth_accounts`, `profiles`, `user_skills`, `custom_universities`, `sessions`) |
| University data | **Real** — 244 seeded universities across seven regions, searchable, plus student-added universities persisted to Postgres |
| Skills data | **Real** — 9 categories, ~190 skills, custom skills, case-insensitive duplicate prevention, persisted per user |
| Onboarding | Built and persisted; progress resumes where the student stopped |
| Student verification | Built UI, all four states; the *approval step* is still simulated (no verification provider) |
| Dashboard, Tasks, Jobs, Internships | Built on demo listings |
| Search, filters, sorting, saved | Built, in-memory + `localStorage` |
| Apply → Paid pipeline | Built; stage changes are demo buttons |
| Profile, ratings, reviews | Built on demo data |
| Payments (USDC balances, ledger) | Built; **no chain transaction exists** |
| AI Opportunity Finder | Built wizard, ranked and explained results; **no live web search ran** |
| Asset Leasing, Inventory Loans, Digital Pawn Shop | Product pages with real explanatory flows; no listing, loan, valuation or pledge is processed — labelled **COMING SOON** |
| Marketplace, Scholarships, Social, Off-ramp | Visually complete, labelled **COMING SOON** |
| Testimonials, FAQ, footer, About/Privacy/Terms/Contact pages | Built; testimonials are product previews, not results from this prototype |

Demo money references are prefixed `demo-ref-` on purpose. Nothing in this
repository signs, broadcasts or stores anything on a blockchain.

## Architecture

```
src/
  app/                 routes (App Router)
    page.tsx           landing
    signin, verify, onboarding
    api/               auth (google/email/session/signout), profile,
                       universities, health — all Node runtime
    app/               authenticated shell + dashboard, tasks, jobs,
                       internships, work, payments, profile, ai,
                       leasing, loans, pawn,
                       marketplace, scholarships, social, offramp
    about, privacy, terms, contact
  components/          AppShell, cards, Browse, OpportunityDetail, ComingSoon,
                       UniversityPicker, SkillsPicker, PageShell,
                       landing/ (Products, Testimonials, Faq, SiteFooter),
                       ui.tsx (buttons, tags, badges, modal, icons)
  lib/
    auth.ts            Google OAuth, scrypt email auth, account de-duplication
    db.ts              Neon client (server-only)
    session.ts         signed HttpOnly session cookie
    universities.ts     global university catalogue + search
    skills.ts          categorised skill library, sanitising, de-duplication
  lib/
    types.ts           the data contracts
    data.ts            demo listings, transactions, reviews, notifications
    store.tsx          session, verification, onboarding, applications, theme
    ai.ts              discovery pipeline + SourceAdapter interface
```

`src/lib/ai.ts` is where the real work goes. It defines `SourceAdapter` and
`RawListing` so permitted sources (public job boards, company career pages,
campus boards, approved partner APIs) can be added without touching the UI.
`runSearch()` today ranks the local demo set and returns the same
`AiResult` shape a live implementation would.

`src/lib/store.tsx` keeps session, verification, onboarding, applications and
theme in one place. When a real account is signed in it reads and writes
through `/api/profile` to Postgres; without one it falls back to `localStorage`
so the prototype still runs with no database configured.

`db/migrations/` holds the schema and `npm run db:migrate` applies it
idempotently (`schema_migrations` tracks what has run).

## Accessibility

Contrast is measured, not guessed. Every text node on every route was audited
in both themes after the build; the dark theme reports zero nodes below its
WCAG threshold and the light theme's only remaining flags are white type over
the art-directed photographs. Focus is visible (`:focus-visible`), targets are
at least 40px, and `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the motion.

## Deploying

Built for Vercel and deployed at <https://earnly-app.vercel.app>. The OAuth
callback, database and session variables are set in the Vercel project (see
*Environment variables* above); no key lives in the repository.

Note: `earnly.vercel.app` is a different project owned by someone else — this
deployment answers on `earnly-app.vercel.app`, `earnly-student.vercel.app` and
`getearnly.vercel.app`.
